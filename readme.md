#Introduction

Clicker is a Web-based manager for Linux machine; a remote control, if you will. With Clicker, you can open, close, install and uninstall programs, manage files, run background scripts, manage files, \&c.

As the project is still in its infancy, it is far from production-level. **Use at your own risk.**

#Risks

* Excessive use of this program may result in obsessive messing with your machine's settings, which may be catastrophic to your love life.
* Always exercise caution when you are using this or any other configuration program. It may be hazardous to your computer and, by extension, your health. (Hey, you never know.)
* There is a slight risk that we will *hunt you down.*

Have fun!
